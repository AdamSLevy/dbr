TODO:
 - Write some tests that hit the actual database.
 - Write tests for insert that hit db
 - wire up insert to instrument, make a test for that

 - Ideas:
   - selectBuilder.Query() *sql.Rows, err		// We might want to provide native sql.Rows support? Q: how does that impact metrics
   - selectBuilder.Count() -- ignores Columns, Limit, Offset, Order and calculates COUNT(*) -- but: having could reference cols?
